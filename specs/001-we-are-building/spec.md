# Feature Specification: Digital Document Processing System

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-are-building`  
**Created**: 2025-09-17  
**Status**: Ready for Development Planning  
**Input**: User description: "We are building a digital document processing system. The application will consist of an API, Database and a user portal (SPA). All of the business logic will be handled by the API. The SPA will surface the following to the system users: User management,Upload Files,Manage Files,View/Share Files. The application will eventually need to accept files from external sources to allow flexibility. Users could potentially email a document to our system or securely upload via FTP. Once a file is obtained by the document processing system it will be processed. There will be a default processing pipeline to begin with. It will be mult-stage and some stages will be long running. Some multi-stage pipelines may require user interaction in the middle of the otherwise automated processing pipeline."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: Digital document processing system with web portal, multi-channel intake, automated processing pipeline
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: System users, external document sources
   ‚Üí Actions: Upload, manage, view/share files, email/FTP intake, automated processing
   ‚Üí Data: Documents, user accounts, processing states
   ‚Üí Constraints: Multi-stage pipeline, user interaction required mid-process
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ User authentication and authorization model: OAUTH2 with PKCE, role-based access control
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Document retention and deletion policies: These values are configurable by admin users of the system
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Processing pipeline failure handling: Each pipeline component should have configurations governing if a component should retry and number of times to retry if appropriate. On failure after retry policy, the state of file processing should be set to Error and provide error details.
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ File size and format limitations: These values are configurable by admin users of the system. They default to accepting files of type PDF, Office document formats and text formats. Files of up to 10MB are accepted by default.
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Email/FTP intake: Email requires white-listed domains (Phase 2), FTP uses secure upload (Phase 2)
   ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Sharing permissions model: Role-based sharing with expiration dates and access levels (view/download)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: User uploads document ‚Üí System processes ‚Üí User manages/shares
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements marked as testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Users, Documents, Processing Jobs, Pipeline Stages
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ All clarifications resolved
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a system user, I want to upload documents to the system so that they can be automatically processed and made available for management and sharing. I also want the system to accept documents from external sources like email and FTP to provide flexible intake options.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a logged-in user, **When** I upload a document through the web portal, **Then** the document should be accepted and enter the processing pipeline
2. **Given** I have uploaded a document, **When** the processing pipeline completes, **Then** I should be able to view, manage, and share the processed document
3. **Given** a document is sent to the system via email, **When** the system receives it, **Then** it should be processed through the same pipeline as manually uploaded documents
4. **Given** a document is in a multi-stage pipeline requiring user interaction, **When** the system reaches that stage, **Then** I should be notified and able to provide the required input
5. **Given** I am managing my documents, **When** I search for a specific file, **Then** the system should return relevant results based on document metadata and content
6. **Given** I want to share a document, **When** I generate a share link, **Then** authorized recipients should be able to access the document with appropriate permissions (view-only or download) and expiration dates

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a document upload fails or is corrupted?
- How does the system handle processing pipeline failures or timeouts?
- What occurs when a user doesn't respond to required interaction within a reasonable timeframe?
- How are duplicate documents handled across different intake channels?
- What happens when storage limits are reached?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create and manage user accounts
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a web-based portal for user interactions
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to upload documents through the web portal
- **FR-004**: System MUST accept documents via email intake. Email address format must be of a white-listed domain, as configured by system administrators. This is a Phase-2 Requirement.
- **FR-005**: System MUST accept documents via secure FTP upload. This is a Phase-2 requirement.
- **FR-006**: System MUST process all incoming documents through a configurable multi-stage pipeline
- **FR-007**: System MUST support long-running processing stages without blocking user interface
- **FR-008**: System MUST pause pipeline execution when user interaction is required and notify the user
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to view and manage their uploaded documents
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide document sharing capabilities with access controls
- **FR-011**: System MUST authenticate users before granting access. Using SSO via OAUTH2 + PKCE.
- **FR-012**: System MUST log all document operations for audit purposes
- **FR-013**: System MUST support concurrent processing of multiple documents
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide status tracking for documents in the processing pipeline
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle processing errors gracefully and provide user notification
- **FR-016**: System MUST support file format validation 
- **FR-017**: System MUST enforce file size limitations
- **FR-018**: System MUST retain document processing history and metadata
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide search capabilities across uploaded documents
- **FR-020**: System MUST implement data backup and recovery procedures with configurable backup frequency and retention periods set by administrators
- **FR-021**: System MUST support role-based document sharing with configurable access levels (view-only, download) and expiration dates

### Key Entities
- **User**: Represents system users with authentication credentials, permissions, and associated documents
- **Document**: Represents uploaded files with metadata (name, size, format, upload date), processing status, and content
- **Processing Job**: Represents a document's journey through the pipeline with current stage, status, timestamps, and user interaction requirements
- **Pipeline Stage**: Represents individual processing steps with configuration, dependencies, and execution requirements
- **Share Link**: Represents document sharing permissions with access controls, expiration dates, and recipient information
- **Audit Log**: Represents system activity records with user actions, timestamps, and security events
