# Research: Digital Document Processing System

**Date**: 2025-09-17  
**Feature**: Document Processing System  
**Status**: Complete  

## Technology Stack Decisions

### .NET Aspire Architecture
**Decision**: Use .NET 9 Aspire for application orchestration and service management  
**Rationale**: 
- Built-in service discovery, configuration management, and telemetry
- Simplifies microservice-like architecture without complexity overhead
- Native support for PostgreSQL, Redis, and Azure services
- Excellent developer experience with dashboard and logging
- Aligns with constitutional principle of pragmatic simplicity

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Raw Docker Compose: More setup complexity, no built-in observability
- Kubernetes: Overkill for single-tenant application
- Monolithic approach: Wouldn't support future scaling requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
**Decision**: Microsoft Entra ID with OAuth2/OIDC integration  
**Rationale**:
- Enterprise-grade identity provider
- Built-in support for role-based access control
- Compliance with security constitutional requirements
- Native integration with ASP.NET Core
- Supports multi-factor authentication out of the box

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom JWT implementation: Higher security risk, more maintenance
- Auth0: Additional vendor dependency and cost
- Azure AD B2C: Overkill for B2B scenarios

### Frontend Technology
**Decision**: Blazor Server with SignalR for real-time updates  
**Rationale**:
- Unified C# development stack
- Real-time pipeline status updates via SignalR
- Better performance for document-heavy operations
- Simplified state management compared to SPA frameworks
- Strong typing and component model

**Alternatives Considered**:
- React/Angular SPA: Additional JavaScript complexity, separate deployment
- Blazor WebAssembly: Larger download size, limited real-time capabilities
- MVC with jQuery: Legacy approach, poor user experience

### Database & Storage
**Decision**: PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core + Azure Blob Storage  
**Rationale**:
- PostgreSQL excellent for relational data and search capabilities
- Entity Framework Core provides strong ORM with migration support
- Blob storage optimal for large file handling
- Clear separation of structured vs. unstructured data
- Built-in backup and scaling capabilities

**Alternatives Considered**:
- SQL Server: Higher licensing costs, less container-friendly
- MongoDB: Poor fit for relational user/document data
- File system storage: No built-in redundancy or CDN capabilities

### Processing Pipeline Architecture
**Decision**: Event-driven pipeline with background services and message queues  
**Rationale**:
- Aligns with constitutional requirement for asynchronous communication
- Supports long-running operations without blocking UI
- Easy to add new processing stages
- Built-in retry and error handling capabilities
- Horizontally scalable

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Synchronous processing: Poor user experience for long operations
- External workflow engines: Additional complexity and vendor dependency
- Function-based processing: Limited state management capabilities

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: xUnit with comprehensive test pyramid approach  
**Rationale**:
- Native .NET test framework
- Excellent async/await support
- Strong mocking capabilities with Moq
- Integration test support with WebApplicationFactory
- Contract testing with API specifications

**Alternatives Considered**:
- NUnit: Less async-friendly syntax
- MSTest: Limited mocking ecosystem
- SpecFlow: Overkill for technical team scenarios

## Performance & Scalability Considerations

### Concurrency Strategy
- Use async/await throughout for I/O operations
- Background services for pipeline processing
- Connection pooling for database operations
- Blob storage CDN for file distribution

### Monitoring & Observability
- .NET Aspire dashboard for development
- Application Insights for production telemetry
- Structured logging with Serilog
- Health checks for all services
- Performance counters for pipeline throughput

### Security Implementation
- HTTPS enforcement with HSTS
- Content Security Policy headers
- File upload validation and virus scanning
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- Audit logging for all operations

## Constitutional Compliance Verification

✅ **Specification as Source**: Research based on approved feature specification  
✅ **Vertical Slices**: Technology stack supports cohesive feature delivery  
✅ **Asynchronous Events**: Event-driven pipeline architecture planned  
✅ **Contracts First**: OpenAPI and event schema planning included  
✅ **Security Non-Negotiable**: Enterprise auth and encryption planned  
✅ **Observability by Default**: Comprehensive monitoring strategy defined  
✅ **Pragmatic Simplicity**: .NET Aspire reduces operational complexity  

## Next Steps
1. Create data model based on entities from specification
2. Define API contracts for all user interactions
3. Design event schemas for pipeline communication
4. Create quickstart development guide
5. Generate implementation tasks
