# Implementation Plan: Digital Document Processing System

**Branch**: `001-we-are-building` | **Date**: 2025-09-17 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `C:/DEV/spec-kit/DocumentManager/specs/001-we-are-building/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Digital document processing system with web portal for document upload, management, and sharing. Features multi-stage processing pipelines with user interaction capabilities, OAuth2 authentication, and role-based access control. Built using .NET 9 Aspire architecture with Blazor frontend, Web API backend, PostgreSQL database, and Microsoft Entra ID for identity management.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: C# / .NET 9  
**Primary Dependencies**: ASP.NET Core Web API, Blazor Server/WASM, Microsoft Entra ID, Entity Framework Core  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL database with Entity Framework Core  
**Testing**: xUnit for unit and integration testing  
**Target Platform**: Linux containers (Docker), deployable to Azure Container Apps/Kubernetes  
**Project Type**: web (Blazor frontend + Web API backend)  
**Performance Goals**: Support 1000 concurrent users, <500ms document upload response time  
**Constraints**: OAuth2/OIDC compliance, GDPR compliance for document retention, 10MB default file size limit  
**Scale/Scope**: 10,000+ users, multi-tenant capable, 1M+ documents storage capacity  
**Architecture**: .NET Aspire orchestration with service discovery, telemetry, and configuration management

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Core Principle Compliance
- **✅ Specification as Source of Truth**: Feature spec complete and approved with acceptance criteria
- **✅ Vertical Slices**: Document processing system designed as cohesive vertical slice with complete user value
- **✅ Asynchronous Events**: Multi-stage pipeline will use event-driven architecture for stage communication
- **✅ Contracts First**: Will define OpenAPI specs for Web API and event schemas for pipeline communication
- **✅ Security Non-Negotiable**: OAuth2/OIDC with Microsoft Entra ID, encryption at rest/transit, audit logging
- **✅ Observability by Default**: .NET Aspire provides built-in telemetry, logging, and distributed tracing
- **✅ Pragmatic Simplicity**: .NET Aspire chosen for its built-in orchestration vs. complex microservices setup

### Architectural Decisions
- **Event-Driven Pipeline**: Document processing stages communicate via events (complies with Principle III)
- **API-First Design**: Web API contracts defined before implementation (complies with Principle IV)
- **Built-in Security**: Microsoft Entra ID integration provides enterprise-grade auth (complies with Principle V)
- **Aspire Observability**: Leverages built-in telemetry stack (complies with Principle VI)

### Potential Complexity Areas
- **Pipeline Engine**: Multi-stage processing with user interaction - justified by core business requirement
- **File Storage**: Blob storage with metadata indexing - justified by document management requirements
- **Real-time Notifications**: SignalR for pipeline status updates - justified by user experience requirements

**Status**: ✅ PASS - All constitutional principles addressed

- ✅ `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - AI assistant context

**Constitutional Re-evaluation**: ✅ PASS - All principles maintained in design phase

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
Based on the design artifacts created in Phase 1, the /tasks command will generate implementation tasks following TDD principles:

1. **Infrastructure Setup Tasks**:
   - Create .NET Aspire AppHost project
   - Configure PostgreSQL with Entity Framework
   - Set up Azure Blob Storage integration
   - Configure Microsoft Entra ID authentication

2. **Data Layer Tasks** (from data-model.md):
   - Create entity classes for each data model
   - Implement Entity Framework configurations
   - Create repository interfaces and implementations
   - Generate and apply database migrations
   - Implement audit logging infrastructure

3. **API Contract Tasks** (from api-contract.yaml):
   - Generate API controllers from OpenAPI spec
   - Implement request/response DTOs
   - Create contract test files for each endpoint
   - Implement authentication middleware
   - Add API documentation generation

4. **Event System Tasks** (from events.json):
   - Create event message classes from schemas
   - Implement event publisher/subscriber infrastructure
   - Set up background services for processing pipeline
   - Create event handlers for each processing stage
   - Implement SignalR hubs for real-time updates

5. **Frontend Tasks**:
   - Create Blazor components for document management
   - Implement file upload functionality
   - Create processing status monitoring UI
   - Implement document sharing interface
   - Add real-time updates via SignalR

6. **Integration Tasks** (from quickstart.md):
   - Implement all quickstart validation scenarios as integration tests
   - Create health check endpoints
   - Set up application monitoring and logging
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - Create deployment scripts

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **TDD Order**: Contract tests → Data layer → API implementation → Frontend
- **Dependency Order**: Infrastructure → Entities → Services → Controllers → UI
- **Parallel Opportunities**: Mark independent tasks with [P] for concurrent development

**Estimated Task Count**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks

**Priority Levels**:
- P0: Core infrastructure and authentication (tasks 1-8)
- P1: Document upload and basic management (tasks 9-20)
- P2: Processing pipeline implementation (tasks 21-30)
- P3: Advanced features and polish (tasks 31-40)

**Implementation Phases**:
- **Phase 2A**: P0 + P1 tasks (MVP with basic document management)
- **Phase 2B**: P2 tasks (processing pipeline)  
- **Phase 2C**: P3 tasks (advanced features, sharing, admin)

**Constitutional Compliance Tasks**:
- Each phase includes observability implementation
- Security validation at each tier
- Event-driven communication patterns
- Contract-first development approach

**IMPORTANT**: These tasks will be generated by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
